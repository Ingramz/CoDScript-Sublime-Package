# CoDScript Sublime Package
by Indrek 'Ingram' Ardel

This package is not maintained anymore. Use [Atom](https://atom.io/) and its [codscript package](https://atom.io/packages/language-codscript) instead, because it is free!

This is supposed to work mainly with Sublime Text 2 (www.sublimetext.com/dev), but should work as well in TextMate.
The main goal is to support proper syntax highlighting for that specific editor.

CoDScript is a derivation of QuakeC Scripting language, it is a C-like language which is heavily simplified.


Installation

Sublime Text 2:

Extract the CoDScript folder into
%appdata%\Sublime Text 2\Packages
