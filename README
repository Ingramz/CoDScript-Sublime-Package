CoDScript TextMate bundle

by Indrek 'Ingram' Ardel


This is supposed to work mainly with Sublime Text 2, but should work as well in TextMate.
The main goal is to support proper syntax highlighting for that specific editor.

CoDScript is a derivation of QuakeC Scripting language, it is a C-like language which is heavily simplified.

*This is still work in progress*


Installation

Sublime Text 2:

Extract the CoDScript folder into
%appdata%\Sublime Text 2\Packages
